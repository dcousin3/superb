``superbPlot()`` comes with seven built-in layouts for plotting your data.
However, it is possible to add additional, custom-made layouts. In this
vignette, we present rapidly the existing layouts, then show how
to supplement ``superb`` with your own layouts.


## The built-in plot layouts


When calling ``superbPlot()``, you use the ``plotStyle = "layout"`` option
to indicate which layout you wish to use. Internally, ``superbPlot()``
is calling a function whose name is ``superbPlot."layout"()``. For example,
with ``plotStyle = "line"``, the plot is actually performed by the 
function ``superbPlot.line()``.


The seven layout available in  ``superbPlot`` package are :

* ``superbPlot.line()`` : shows the results as points and lines, 

* ``superbPlot.lineBand()``: Shows the confidence intervals as a semi-transparent band rather than with bars.

* ``superbPlot.point()``: shows the results as points only, 

* ``superbPlot.bar()`` : shows the results using bars, 

* ``superbPlot.pointjitter()``: shows the results with points, and the raw data with jittered points, 

* ``superbPlot.pointjitterviolin()``: also shows violin plot behind the jitter points, and 

* ``superbPlot.pointindividualline()``: show the results with fat points, and individual results with thin lines, 

* ``superbPlot.raincloud()``: Shows the results with distribution and jitter.

To determine if a certain function is ``superbPlot``-compatible, 
use the following function:

```{r}
superb:::is.superbPlot.function("superbPlot.line")
```

where you put between quote the name of a function. When devising your
own, custom-made function, it is a good thing to check that it is
``superbPlot``-compatible.


## Illustrating some of the built-in layouts

To get a sense of the currently available layouts, we first generate 
a dataset composed of randomly generated scores mimicking a 3 $\times$
2 design with three degrees of Difficulties (as a between-group 
factor) and two days of testing (as a within-subject factor). It
is believed (and simulated) that all two factors have main effets on
the scores.

```{r}
testdata <- GRD(
    RenameDV   = "score", 
    SubjectsPerGroup = 25, 
    BSFactors  = "Difficulty(3)", 
    WSFactors  = "Day(day1, day2)",
    Population = list(mean = 65,stddev = 12,rho = 0.5),
    Effects    = list("Day" = slope(-5), "Difficulty" = slope(3) )
)
head(testdata)
```

For simplicity, we define a function whose arguments are the dataset and the layout:

```{r}
mp <- function(data, style, ...) {
    superbPlot(data,
        WSFactors = "Day(2)",
        BSFactors = "Difficulty",
        variables = c("score.day1", "score.day2"),
        adjustments = list(purpose="difference", decorrelation="CM"),
        plotStyle = style,
        ...
    )+labs(title = paste("Layout is ''",style,"''",sep=""))
}
```

Lets compute the plots will the first six built-in layouts and show them

```{r, fig.width= 7, fig.height = 7, fig.cap = "**Figure 1a**. Look of the six built-in layouts on the same random dataset"}
p1 <- mp(testdata, "bar")
p2 <- mp(testdata, "point")
p3 <- mp(testdata, "line")
p4 <- mp(testdata, "pointjitter" )
p5 <- mp(testdata, "pointjitterviolin")
p6 <- mp(testdata, "pointindividualline")

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,ncol=2)
```

The last format, a ``raincloud`` plot [@pw21], is better seen with coordinates flipped over:

```{r, fig.width =7, fig.height = 3.5, fig.cap = "**Figure 1b**. The seventh layout, the raincloud"}
mp(testdata, "raincloud") + coord_flip()
```

For more controls, you can manually set the colors, the fills and/or
the shapes, as done here in a list:

```{r, fig.width= 7, fig.height = 7, fig.cap = "**Figure 2a**. The six built-in template with ornamental styling added."}
ornate = list( 
    scale_colour_manual( name = "Difference", 
        labels = c("Easy", "Hard", "Unthinkable"), 
        values = c("blue", "black", "purple")) ,
    scale_fill_manual( name = "Difference", 
        labels = c("Easy", "Hard", "Unthinkable"), 
        values = c("blue", "black", "purple")) ,
    scale_shape_manual( name = "Difference", 
        labels = c("Easy", "Hard", "Unthinkable") ,
        values = c(0, 10, 13)) ,
    theme_bw(base_size = 9) ,
    labs(x = "Days of test", y = "Score in points" ),
    scale_x_discrete(labels=c("1" = "Former day", "2" = "Latter day"))
)
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(
    p1+ornate, p2+ornate, p3+ornate,
    p4+ornate, p5+ornate, p6+ornate,
    ncol=2)
```

These are just a few examples. However, if these layouts do not fit
yours needs, it is possible to devise a custom-made layout and 
inform ``superbPlot`` to use it. To that end, see the instructions
below.


## Devising a custom-made plot layout

In a nutshell, the purpose of ``superbPlot()`` is to 

* compile the summary information
(location of the summary statistic, upper width and lower width of 
the interval) and that, for each level of the factors; 

* applies all the adjustments needed in producing the summary;

* and finally, calls a plot function accepting pre-defined 
arguments

In devising your own plot function, it is important that (i) the 
function name begins with ``superbPlot.``; (ii) the
function accept very specific arguments with very precise names.

Here is the header for a function corresponding to a
plot style called, say, *foo* (``plotStyle = "foo"``):

```{r}
superbPlot.foo <- function(
    summarydata,
    xfactor,       
    groupingfactor,
    addfactors, 
    rawdata        
    # any optional argument you wish
) {
    plot <- ggplot() ## ggplot instructions...        
    return(plot)
}
```

In what follow, it is assumed that one factor is placed on the
horizontal axis (``xfactor``), another one is used to group the 
point (``groupingfactor``), and up to two additional
 factors will results in columns and rows of panels
 (``addfactors``; of course, in devising your own template,
you may use different placement). ``superbPlot()`` is restricted
to a maximum of four factors. 


The arguments are:

* ``summarydata``: this data frame will contain the column ``center``
indicating the statistic's value, ``lowerwidth`` and ``upperwidth``
indicating how many units below and above ``center`` the error bar
extends. The data frame will also have columns for all the factors, 
and there will be as many lines as there are combinations of factors.

* ``xfactor`` is the factor to put on the horizontal axis;

* ``groupingfactor`` is the factor used to create groups of points;

* ``addfactors`` are up to two additional factors to create the 
rows and columns of panels. ``addfactors`` is formatted for facetting
(e.g., for factors "A" and "B", ``addfactors`` would be "A~B");

* ``rawdata`` : this data.frame contains the raw data with factors
being transformed ``as.factor`` and the dependent column being renamed
``DV``. When the data are in wide format, ``rawdata`` is reshaped to
long format.

* ``{optional arguments}`` can be used. They must be named here; when 
calling ``superbPlot()``, any argument whose name match your optional
argument will be transmitted to your custom-made function.


## The simplest example


What follow is a simple example that will design a template 
that we will call ``simple``. This layout will display the
descriptive statistics and error bars. Everything will be
black and white (no color instruction) and superimposed
(no grouping instruction).

The result will be:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.cap="**Figure 3**. Mean score with 95% confidence interval using the ``simple`` plot layout."}
superbPlot.simple <- function( summarydata, xfactor, groupingfactor, addfactors, rawdata ) {
    plot <- ggplot(
        data = summarydata,
        mapping = aes_string( x = xfactor, y = "center", group= groupingfactor)
    ) +
    geom_point( ) +
    geom_errorbar( mapping = aes_string(ymin = "center + lowerwidth", ymax = "center + upperwidth")  )+
    facet_grid( addfactors )
       
    return(plot)
}
superbPlot(TMB1964r,
    WSFactors = "T(7)",
    BSFactors = "Condition",
    variables = c("T1","T2","T3","T4","T5","T6","T7"),
    plotStyle = "simple"
)
```

To make this plot, we design a function ``superbPlot.simple`` as:

```{r}
superbPlot.simple <- function(
    summarydata, xfactor, groupingfactor, addfactors, rawdata
) {
    plot <- ggplot(
        data = summarydata, 
        mapping = aes_string( x = xfactor, y = "center", group=groupingfactor)
    ) +
    geom_point(  ) +
    geom_errorbar( mapping = aes_string(ymin = "center + lowerwidth", 
                                        ymax = "center + upperwidth")  )+ 
    facet_grid( addfactors )
        
    return(plot)
}
```

The first instruction, ``ggplot`` defines the source data to be 
``summarydata`` with horizontal axis being in the string ``xfactor``
(this is the reason that ``mapping`` must be given with ``aes_string``).
The position of the descriptive statistics is automatically 
computed and stored in a column called ``"center"``.

The second instruction put points for each ``"center"``, and 
the third instruction places error bars. In that case, the ``ymin`` and 
``ymax`` information are contained in ``center+lowerwidth`` and
``center+upperwidth`` where ``lowerwidth`` and ``upperwidth`` are
automaticall computed and stored in the ``summarydata`` dataframe.

The last instructions generates distinct panels for each level of the
remaining factors.
 
You can check that this function is ``superbPlot``-compatible with:

```{r}
superb:::is.superbPlot.function("superbPlot.simple")
```

If ``TRUE``, then we are ready to use this layout, here with the
demo dataset ``TMB1964r`` whose result was shown above in Figure 3:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='hide', fig.show='hide'}
superbPlot(TMB1964r,
     WSFactors = "T(7)",      
     BSFactors = "Condition",
     variables = c("T1","T2","T3","T4","T5","T6","T7"),
     plotStyle = "simple"
)
```


## Optional arguments

The above ``simple`` layout does not accept optional arguments. To
integrate optional arguments, one method is to insert graphic
directives inside the layers, e.g., inside ``geom_point``. 

A convenient method is with ``do.call`` and ``modifyList``, for example:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
    do.call( geom_point, modifyList(
       list( size= 3 ##etc., the default directives##
       ), myownParams
    ))
```

A full example it therefore

```{r}
superbPlot.simpleWithOptions <- function(
    summarydata, xfactor, groupingfactor, addfactors, rawdata,
    myownParams = list()  ## will be used to add the optional arguments to the function
) {
    plot <- ggplot(
        data = summarydata, 
        mapping = aes_string( x = xfactor, y = "center", group="Condition")
    ) +
    do.call( geom_point, modifyList(
       list( color ="black" ),
        myownParams
    )) + 
    do.call( geom_errorbar, modifyList(
        list( mapping = aes_string(ymin = "center + lowerwidth", 
                                   ymax = "center + upperwidth")  ),
        myownParams 
    )) + 
    facet_grid( addfactors )
        
    return(plot)
}
superb:::is.superbPlot.function("superbPlot.simpleWithOptions")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='hide', fig.show='show', fig.cap="**Figure 4**. A simple figure with optional arguments"}
superbPlot(TMB1964r,
    WSFactors = "T(7)",      
    BSFactors = "Condition",
    variables = c("T1","T2","T3","T4","T5","T6","T7"),
    plotStyle = "simpleWithOptions", 
    ## here goes the optional arguments
    myownParams = list(size=1, color="purple", position = position_dodge(width = 0.3) ) 
)
```

In that example, the same parameters are sent to ``geom_point`` and to
``geom_errorbar``. It is left as an exercice to the reader to use two 
distinct sets of optional parameters, one for the points, the other for the 
error bars.



## Getting feedback information

It is sometimes useful to extract variables out of the function
when debugging the code. A useful function is to use ``runDebug()``.
This function (shipped with ``suberb``) will display text and
transfer any variables you want into the global environment.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
options(superb.feedback = 'all')
runDebug( 'where are we?', "Text to show when we get there",
  c("variable1", "variable2", "etc"),
  list( "var1InTheFct", "var2InTheFct", "varetcInTheFct")
)
```

For example, the following will get the dataframes:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
superbPlot.empty <- function(
    summarydata, xfactor, groupingfactor, addfactors, rawdata 
) {
    runDebug( 'inempty', "Dumping the two dataframes",
        c("summary","raw"), list(summarydata, rawdata))

    plot <- ggplot() # an empty plot        
    return(plot)
}
options(superb.feedback = 'inempty')  ## turn on feedback when reaching 'inempty'
superbPlot(TMB1964r,
     WSFactors = "T(7)",      
     BSFactors = "Condition",
     variables = c("T1","T2","T3","T4","T5","T6","T7"),
     plotStyle = "empty" 
)
```

You see  ``Dumping the two dataframes``
 followed by ``summary`` and ``raw``. These two variables
are now in the global environment and you can manipulate them. 
You can also use them in testing your plotting functions, for example

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='hide', fig.show='hide'}
superbPlot.simple(summary, "T", "Condition", ".~.", raw)
``` 



## An example

In what follow, we create a toy example where the raw data
will be shown with smileys. Note that this example may not
work in Rstudio (see "limitation" on emojifont 
[page](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emojifont)
)

We first need the ``emojifont`` library

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages("emojifont")
library(emojifont)
```

Then we define a ``"smiley"`` layout where the emojis are shown
with ``geom_text`` layer:

```{r}
superbPlot.smiley <- function(
    summarydata, xfactor, groupingfactor, addfactors, rawdata 
) {
    # the early part bears on summary data with variable "center"
    plot <- ggplot(
        data = summarydata, 
        mapping = aes_string(
            x = xfactor, y = "center", 
            fill = groupingfactor, 
            shape = groupingfactor, 
            colour = groupingfactor)
    ) +
    geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = .95)) +
    geom_errorbar( width = .6, position = position_dodge(.95), 
              mapping = aes_string(ymin = "center + lowerwidth", ymax = "center + upperwidth") 
    )+ 
    # this part bears on the rawdata only with variable "DV"
    geom_text(data = rawdata, 
              position = position_jitter(0.5),
              family="EmojiOne", label=emoji("smile"), size=6, 
              mapping=aes_string(x=xfactor, y="DV", group = groupingfactor)
    ) +
    facet_grid( addfactors )
        
    return(plot)
}
```

We check that it is a ``superbPlot``-compatible function:

```{r}
superb:::is.superbPlot.function("superbPlot.smiley")
```

It is all we need! It can be inserted in a ``superbPlot`` call:

```{r, fig.width= 4, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = "**Figure 5**. smile!", fig.show='hide'}
superbPlot(TMB1964r,
     WSFactors = "T(7)",      
     BSFactors = "Condition", 
     variables = c("T1","T2","T3","T4","T5","T6","T7"),
     plotStyle = "smiley"
)
```

(the result is not shown).
