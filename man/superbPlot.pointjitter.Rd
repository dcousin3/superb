\arguments{
\item{summarydata}{a data.frame with columns "center", "lowerwidth" and "upperwidth" for each level of the factors;}

\item{xfactor}{a string with the name of the column where the factor going on the horizontal axis is given;}

\item{groupingfactor}{a string with the name of the column for which the data will be grouped on the plot;}

\item{addfactors}{a string with up to two additional factors to make the rows and columns panels, in the form "fact1 ~ fact2";}

\item{rawdata}{always contains "DV" for each participants and each level of the factors}

\item{pointParams}{(optional) list of graphic directives that are sent to the geom_bar layer}

\item{jitterParams}{(optional) list of graphic directives that are sent to the geom_bar layer}

\item{errorbarParams}{(optional) list of graphic directives that are sent to the geom_errorbar layer}

\item{facetParams}{(optional) list of graphic directives that are sent to the facet_grid layer}

\item{xAsFactor}{(optional) Boolean to indicate if the factor on the horizontal should continuous or discrete (default is discrete)}

\description{
superbPlot comes with a few built-in templates for making the final plots.
All produces ggplot objects that can be further customized. Additionally, it is
possible to add custom-make templates (see vignette 6). The functions, to be
"superbPlot-compatible", must have these parameters:

\examples{
# This will make a plot with jittered points, aka dot plots
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
   BSFactors = c("dose","supp"), variables = "len",
   plotStyle="pointjitter" 
)

# if you extract the data with superbData, you can 
# run this layout directly
processedData <- superbData(ToothGrowth, 
   BSFactors = c("dose","supp"), variables = "len"
)

superbPlot.pointjitter(processedData$summaryStatistic,
   "dose",
   "supp",
   ".~.",
   processedData$rawData)
