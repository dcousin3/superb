\title{User Interface to get summary plot of any statistics with adjusted error bars.}
\usage{
superbShiny()
}
\value{
A plot that can be cut-and-paste.
}
\description{
The function \code{suberbShiny()} provides a simple user interface
to plot standard error or confidence interval for various descriptive
statistics under various designs, population size and purposes,
according to the \code{suberb} framework. See \insertCite{cgh21}{superb} for more.
Also see this \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw_6ll5nVus/}{video}
from \insertCite{w21}{superb} for a demo using
the shinyapps.io installation accessible at
\href{https://dcousin3.shinyapps.io/superbshiny/}{dcousin3.shinyapps.io/superbshiny}
Limitations: it is not possible to use custom-made statistics with the
graphical user interface, nor is it possible to request an adjustment for cluster-
randomized sampling. These options are available with \code{superbPlot()}.
