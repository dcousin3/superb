\title{User Interface to get summary plot of any statistics with adjusted error bars.}
\usage{
superbShiny()
}
\value{
A plot that can be cut-and-paste.
}
\description{
The function \code{suberbShiny()} provides a simple user interface
to plot standard error or confidence interval for various descriptive
statistics under various designs, population size and purposes,
according to the \code{suberb} framework. See \insertCite{c17}{superb} for more.
Limitations: it is not possible to use custom-made statistics with the
user interface, nor is it possible to request an adjustment for cluster-
randomized sampling. These options are available with \code{superbPlot()}.
