[![CRAN
Status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/superb)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=superb)
<!-- badges: end -->

The library `superb` offers three main functions, `superbPlot()`,
`superbData()` and `GRD()`. The purpose of `superbPlot()` is to provide
a plot with summary statistics and correct error bars. With simple
adjustments, the error bar are adjusted to the design (within or
between), to the purpose (single or pair-wise differences), to the
sampling method (simple randomized samples or cluster randomized
samples) and to the population size (infinite or of a specific size).

The `superbData()` function does not generate the plot but returns the
summary statistics and the interval boundaries. These can afterwards be
output to other plotting environment.

`GRD()` is used to easily generate random data from any design (within
or between) using any population distribution with any parameters, and
with various effect sizes. `GRD()` is useful to test statistical
procedures and plotting procedures such as `superbPlot()`.

# Installation

The official **CRAN** version can be installed with

``` r
install.packages("superb")
library(superb)
```

The development version can be accessed through GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("dcousin3/superb")
library(superb)
```

# Examples

This is a simple example illustrating the ToothGrowth (dependent
variable is `len`) of rats as a function of the `dose` of vitamin and
the form of the vitamin `supp` (pills or juice)

``` r
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactor = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len" )
```

In the above, the default summary statistic, the mean, is used. The
error bars are, by default, the 95% confidence intervals. These two
choices can be changed with the `statistic` and the `errorbar`
arguments.

This second example explicitsly indicates to display the `median`
instead of the default `mean` summary statistics

``` r
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactor = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len",
    statistic = "median")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

As a third example, we illustrate the harmonic means `hmedian` along
with 99.9% confidence intervals using lines:

``` r
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactor = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len",
    statistic = "hmean", 
    errorbar = "CI", gamma = 0.999,
    plotStyle = "line")
```

The second function, `GRD()`, can be used to generate random data from
designs with various within- and between-subject factors. This example
generates scores for 300 simulated participants in a 3 x 2 design with
repeated-measures on `Day`s. Only the factor `Day` is simulated to
improve the scores by reducing it:

``` r
testdata <- GRD(
    RenameDV   = "score", 
    SubjectsPerGroup = 100, 
    BSFactors  = "Difficulty(3)", 
    WSFactors  = "Day(2)",
    Population = list(mean = 75,stddev = 12,rho = 0.5),
    Effects    = list("Day" = slope(-3) )
)
head(testdata)
```

    ##   id Difficulty  score.1  score.2
    ## 1  1          1 93.10302 82.03908
    ## 2  2          1 77.31606 87.70924
    ## 3  3          1 80.90919 78.34661
    ## 4  4          1 73.11900 69.86264
    ## 5  5          1 72.58291 51.31221
    ## 6  6          1 76.29325 64.46768

The simulated scores are illustrated using jitter dots as well as a
violin plot to show the distributions:

``` r
superbPlot(testdata, 
    BSFactor  = "Difficulty", 
    WSFactor  = "Day(2)",
    variables = c("score.1","score.2"),
    plotStyle = "pointjitterviolin",
    errorbarParams = list(color = "black"),
    pointParams = list( size = 3, color = "black")
)
```

As seen, `superb` can be used to illustrate summary statistics but also
some characteristics of the raw data.
