# superb: Summary plots with adjusted error bars

[![CRAN Status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/superb)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=superb)
<!-- badges: end -->

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
cat("this will be hidden; use for general initializations.\n")
library(superb)
library(ggplot2)
options("superb.feedback" = "none") # shut down all information
```

The library `superb`  offers two main functionalities. First, it can be used
to obtain plots with adjusted error bars. The main function is `superbPlot()`
but you can also use `superbShiny()` for a graphical user interface requiring
no programming nor scripting.  See the nice tutorial by @w21.

The purpose of `superbPlot()` is to provide a plot with 
summary statistics and correct
error bars. With simple adjustments, the error bar are adjusted
to the design (within or between), to the purpose (single or pair-wise differences),
to the sampling method (simple randomized samples or cluster
randomized samples) and to the population size (infinite or of a specific
 size). The `superbData()` function does not generate the plot but returns the 
summary statistics and the interval boundaries. These can afterwards
be sent to other plotting environment.

 The second functionality is to generate random datasets. The function 
 `GRD()` is used to easily generate random data from any design (within or between) using
any population distribution with any parameters, and with various 
effect sizes. `GRD()` is useful to test statistical procedures and plotting procedures 
such as `superbPlot()`.

# Installation

The official **CRAN** version can be installed with 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("superb")
library(superb)
```

The development version can be accessed through GitHub:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dcousin3/superb")
library(superb)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, results = FALSE}
library(superb)
```

# Examples

The easiest is to use the graphical interface which can be 
launched with 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
superbShiny()
```

The following examples use the script-based commands.

Here is a simple example illustrating the ``ToothGrowth`` dataset
of rats  (in which the dependent variable is `len`) 
as a function of the `dose` of 
vitamin and the form of the vitamin supplements `supp` (pills or juice)

```{r}
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactors = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len" )
```

In the above, the default summary statistic, the mean, is used. The error
bars are, by default, the 95% confidence intervals. These two choices
can be changed with the `statistic` and the `errorbar` arguments.

This second example explicitly indicates to display the 
`median` instead of the default `mean` summary statistics

```{r}
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactors = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len",
    statistic = "median")
```

As a third example, we illustrate the  harmonic means
`hmedian` along with 99.9% confidence intervals using lines:

```{r}
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactors = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len",
    statistic = "hmean", 
    errorbar = "CI", gamma = 0.999,
    plotStyle = "line")
```

The second function, `GRD()`, can be used to generate random data
from designs with various within- and between-subject factors.
This example generates scores for 300 simulated participants in 
a 3 x 2 design with repeated-measures on `Day`s. Only
the factor `Day` is simulated to improve the scores by reducing it:

```{r}
testdata <- GRD(
    RenameDV   = "score", 
    SubjectsPerGroup = 100, 
    BSFactors  = "Difficulty(A,B,C)", 
    WSFactors  = "Day(2)",
    Population = list(mean = 75,stddev = 12,rho = 0.5),
    Effects    = list("Day" = slope(-3) )
)
head(testdata)
```

The simulated scores are illustrated using using a more elaborated layout,
the ``pointjitterviolin`` which, in addition to the mean and confidence interval, 
shows the raw data using jitter dots 
and the distribution using a violin plot:

```{r}
superbPlot(testdata, 
    BSFactors  = "Difficulty", 
    WSFactors  = "Day(2)",
    variables = c("score.1","score.2"),
    plotStyle = "pointjitterviolin",
    errorbarParams = list(color = "purple"),
    pointParams = list( size = 3, color = "purple")
)
```

In the above example, optional arguments ``errorbarParams`` and ``pointParams``
are used to inject specifications in the error bars and the points respectively.
When these arguments are used, they override the defaults from ``superbPlot()``.


# For more

As seen, the library `superb` makes it easy to illustrate summary statistics 
along with the error bars. Some layouts can be used to visualize additional
characteristics of the raw data. Finally, the resulting appearance can be customized 
in various ways.

The complete documentation is available on this [site](https://dcousin3.github.io/superb/).

A general introduction to the `superb` framework underlying this 
library is in press
