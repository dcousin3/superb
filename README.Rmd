The library `superb`  offers two main functions, `superbPlot()` and `GRD()`. 
The purpose of
`superbPlot()` is to provide a plot with summary statistics and correct
error bars. With simple adjustments, the error bar are adjusted
to the design (within or between), to the purpose (single or pair-wise differences),
to the sampling method (simple randomized samples or cluster
randomized samples) and to the population size (infinite or of a specific
 size).

The `superbData()` function does not generate the plot but returns the 
summary statistics and the interval boundaries. These can afterwards
be output to other plotting environment.

`GRD()` is used to easily generate random data from any design (within or between) using
any population distribution with any parameters, and with various 
effect sizes. GRD is useful to test statistical procedures such as 
`aov()` or plotting procedures such as `superbPlot()`.

# Installation

The official **CRAN** version can be installed with 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("superb")
library(superb)
```

The development version can be accessed through GitHub:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dcousin3/superb")
library(superb)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results = FALSE}
library(superb)
```

# Examples

This is a simple example illustrating the ToothGrowth (dependent 
variable is `len`) of rats as a function of the `dose` of 
vitamin and the form of the vitamin `supp` (pills or juice)

```{r}
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactor = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len" )
```

In the above, the defautl summary statistic, the mean, is used. The error
bars are, by default, the 95% confidence intervals. These two choices
can be changed with the `statistic` and the `errorbar` arguments.

This second example explicitely indicates to display the 
`median` instead of the default `mean` summary statistics

```{r}
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactor = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len",
    statistic = "median")
```

As a third example, we illustrate the  harmonic means
`hmedian` along with 99.9% confidence intervals using lines:

```{r}
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactor = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len",
    statistic = "hmean", 
    errorbar = "CI", gamma = 0.999,
    plotStyle = "line")
```

The second function, `GRD`, can be used to generate random data
from designs with various within- and between-subject factors.
This example generates scores for 300 simulated participants in 
a 3 x 2 design with repeated-measures on `Day`s. Only
the factor `Day` is simulated to improve the scores by reducing it:

```{r}
testdata <- GRD(
    RenameDV   = "score", 
    SubjectsPerGroup = 100, 
    BSFactors  = "Difficulty(3)", 
    WSFactors  = "Day(2)",
    Population = list(mean = 75,stddev = 12,rho = 0.5),
    Effects    = list("Day" = slope(-3) )
)
head(testdata)
```

The simulated scores are illustrated using jitter dots as well as
a violin plot to show the distributions:

```{r}
superbPlot(testdata, 
    BSFactor  = "Difficulty", 
    WSFactor  = "Day(2)",
    variables = c("score.1","score.2"),
    plotStyle = "pointjitterviolin"
)
```

As seen, `superb` can be used to illustrate summary statistics but
also some characteristics of the raw data.
