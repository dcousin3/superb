The library `superb`  offers two main functions, `superbPlot()` and `GRD()`. 
The purpose of
`superbPlot()` is to provide a plot with summary statistics and correct
error bars. With simple adjustments, the error bar are adjusted
to the design (within or between), to the purpose (single or pair-wise differences),
to the sampling method (simple randomized samples or cluster
randomized samples) and to the population size (infinite or of a specific
 size).

`GRD()` can easily generate random data from any design (within or between) using
any population distribution with any parameters, and with various 
effect sizes. GRD is useful to test statistical procedures such as 
`aov()` or plotting procedures such as `superbPlot()`.

# Installation

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("superb")
library(superb)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results = FALSE}
library(superb)
```

# Examples

This is a simple example illustrating the ToothGrowth of rats
as a function of the dose of vitamin and the form of the vitamin (pills or juice)

```{r}
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactor = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len" )
```

This explicitely indicates to display the 
median instead of the default mean statistics

```{r}
superbPlot(ToothGrowth, 
    BSFactor = c("dose","supp"), 
    variables = "len",
    statistic = "median")
```

This example generates scores for 3000 simulated participants in 
a 3 x 2 design with repeated-measures on days.
The factor day is belived to improve the scores (reducing it)

```{r}
testdata <- GRD(
    RenameDV   = "score", 
    SubjectsPerGroup = 1000, 
    BSFactors  = "Difficulty(3)", 
    WSFactors  = "Day(2)",
    Population = list(mean = 75,stddev = 12,rho = 0.5),
    Effects    = list("Day" = slope(-3) )
)
head(testdata)

superbPlot(testdata, 
    BSFactor  = "Difficulty", 
    WSFactor  = "Day(2)",
    variables = c("score.1","score.2"),
    plotStyle = "line"
)
```
