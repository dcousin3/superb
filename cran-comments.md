## Resubmission 2
This is the second resubmission. 
* I added () to the only function
name given in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file which
now read "The main function, superbPlot(), can either..."
(I hope I understood correctly the comment);
* I took this opportunity to rephrase a few sentences in the Vignettes.

## Resubmission 1
This is the first resubmission. In this version I have:
* shorten the title to 65 chars.
* expand DESCRIPTION with refs and their doi
* save and restore ``par`` options
* add a NEWS.md detailing history

## Test environments
* local WIN-64x install, R 4.0.3
* win-builder devel 
* win-builder release
* Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS R release (travis-ci.org)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, no WARNINGs and no NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
All packages that I could install passed.
